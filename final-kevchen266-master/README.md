# Final project

**Due Friday, June 12**

### Overview

The goal of the final is to produce a short report, along with code and a simple worked example, on a computational topic of your choosing. What counts as a computational topic? Here are a few examples:

- A computational method or algorithm (e.g., Monte Carlo integration, stochastic gradient descent, breadth-first search)  
- A research topic in physics that uses computational physics (e.g., computing scattering cross sections, simulating fluid dynamics)  
- A method or approach for data analysis (e.g., principle component analysis, logistic regression)  
- A type of data visualization (e.g., box plots, kernel density estimation, density plots)   

If there's something that you're interested in but you're not sure if it's an appropriate topic, please do ask for feedback in the Slack.

### Submitting the final

To submit the final assignment, fill in the Jupyter notebook here and upload it to your GitHub repository as usual.
